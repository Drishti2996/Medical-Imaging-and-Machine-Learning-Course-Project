# Exploring the Benefits of Multi-Task Learning in Surgical Phase Recognition and Tool Detection

Surgical video analysis involves two critical and complex tasks: detecting the presence of surgical tools and
recognizing the surgical phase. These tasks are vital for many modern operating room applications. Although
they are interrelated in clinical practice because of the well-defined surgical process, previous methods have
tackled them separately, without leveraging their connection. In this project, I have implemented an approach
that introduces a multi-task recurrent convolutional network with correlation loss (MTRCNet-CL) that utilizes
their relatedness to enhance the performance of both tasks simultaneously.
